# Hi, I'm Arjun.

## About Me

My primary career goal is to improve as a developer with each contribution. I obtained my Computer Science degree from Oregon State University at the end of 2021 and recently graduated from an accelerated full-stack web development program, LearningFuze. I aspire to develop full-stack web-based applications and am adaptable to variety of languages, tools, and technologies. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.
